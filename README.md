# Reddit Text Classifier

All the requirements are found in `requirements.txt`

All the code is written python and organized in folders. To run any of the algorithms, please first place the `train_input.csv`, `train_output.csv` and `test_input.csv` in the `data` folder. Following this, simply run any `jupyter` notebook as needed.

To run the code for kNN, simply type 

```bash
python knn.py
```

and it will make a prediction for all conversations in test input.
